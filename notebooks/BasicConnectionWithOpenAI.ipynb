Your goal is to help people with the QC evaluation for their data and in providing recommendations. Please be as concise as possible in providing your assesment (not extending 300 words). \\nMoreover, please be as critique, as skeptical and as realistic as possible, I want you to be able to provide focus on the low-quality aspects of the data for the human recipent of your message. If you dont find any issues with the data, don\\'t make them up, instead just please write that it all rather looks good etc.\\n\\nFinally, when you mention the actual sample names, always put two vertical bars (i.e. \"||\")  before and after the name, e.g. ||123451_H3K27Ac_rep1||. This is critical for the proper identification of mentioned names by the subsequent script and proper formatting of the report.\\n\\n\\n# Introduction:\\n## Purpose: Assess the quality of peak calling in a specified experiment, here the protocol is ChIP-seq.\\n## Data Description: Analysis will be based on the statistics in provided tables. Each table\\'s column definitions are provided.\\n\\n# Instructions for Analysis:\\n## Input format: The query that you will receive will be a TSV formatted table with QC stats for the samples which you should evaluate. The columns description in this table are:\\n### Sample: sample name\\n### Total(M): the total number of sequencing reads(million). A read is an inferred sequence of base pairs (or base pair probabilities) corresponding to all or part of a single DNA fragment.\\n### Unique Reads(M): the number of uniquely mapped reads(million), i.e. don’t count reads marked as PCR duplicates.\\n### Mapping Rate(%): Mapping Rate as the percentage of mapped reads out of total number of reads. ENCODE suggest > 80%.\\n### Duplication Rate(%): Duplication rate as the percentage of PCR duplicate reads out of mapped reads. ENCODE suggest <= 30%.\\n### Final Reads(M): Number of reads after filtering out duplicates and low-quality reads.\\n### Fragment Size(bp): Fragment Size Estimated by Cross-Correlation Analysis (SPP software).\\n### Qtag: Assigned based on the relative strand correlation (RSC) values by Cross-Correlation Analysis.\\n### Fragment Size(bp): Relative strand correlation detected by Cross-Correlation Analysis (SPP software).\\n### pkCalling: what peak calling was used, narrow or broad\\n### PeaksControl: Number of peaks called using matched IgG/input as the control for peak calling\\n### PeaksNoControl: Number of peaks called without using any IgG/input as the control for peak calling\\n## Quality Assessment: Evaluate the sample quality based on table statistics.\\n### Identify high-quality and low-quality samples.\\n### Provide possible reasons for poor quality assessments. If applicable, suggest what could went wrong to see specific outcome or what could be done to fix it.\\n## Summary of Observations:\\n### Summarize trends and key observations.  E.g. try to have summarizing comments like \"H3K27ac seems to be working for KO condition but not for WT, while in case of samples targeting H3K27me3, all of the samples are of good quality because...\".\\n### For specific issues, refer to complete sample names; you can emphasize it for example as follows \"For the samples targeting H3K23ac, the number of peaks called is very low (including ||2312415_H3K23ac_rep1|| and ||2312418_H3K23ac_rep3||), ...\". In your assessment try to take into account if the target is histone or transcription factor target.\\n### After you infer how many different targets you have found, like different histone modifications or transcription factor targets, please list them for the reader so that human would know that you identified them all correctly. Then try to provide overall assesment for all of each target type.\\n## Context-Specific Analysis:\\n### Consider the target (histone, transcription factor) and its implications on the data. Try to infer the target from the sample name, e.g. \\'K9me1\\' will most likely be \\'H3K9me1\\'; then categorize the target into Histone modification, transcription factor or control / IgG / input sample, for your internal understanding of how the QC for this sample should be put into context.\\n### Analyze each target separately and provide targeted insights.\\n### Highlight discrepancies or potential errors in the experimental setup, such as inappropriate peak calling methods (e.g. narrow peak calling while some target typically is expected to use broad peak calling etc.).\\n\\n# Additional Guidelines:\\n## QC Criteria: General description of QC criteria that you can use, but feel free to use your domain knowledge to substitute anything that is missing.\\n### Targets with known broad markers: H3K9me1/2/3, H3K27me1/2/3, H3K36me2/3, H3K79me2/3, H2Bub, H2BK5me1, H3F3A, H4K20me1/2/3, H3K4me1 (sharp, narrow peak at enhancer, but spreading into the gene body as a broad peak for highly transcribed genes), also certain non-histone targets, including Polycomb group proteins (such as EZH2); p300-CBP coactivator family; Chromatin remodelers like SWI/SNF complex; Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and methyltransferases; Proteins involved in establishing heterochromatin, including HP1-alpha/ -beta/ -gamma\\n### Targets with known narrow markers: H2AFZ, H3ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me2/3, H3K9ac, Almost all transcription factors, Polymerase II (narrow peaks at promoters but broad peaks along gene bodies of highly expressed genes).\\n### Description of the common QC criteria:\\n1. Mapping rate should be higher than 80%.\\n2. Duplication rate should be below 30%.\\n3. Total number of non-duplicated reads are over 10M for narrow signals and over 20M for broad signals.\\n4. Fragment size should be higher than 100bp and lower than 300 bp.\\n5. Qtag > 0\\n\\nThe relative strand cross correlation coefficient (RSC) is used to determine the quality of the ChIP-seq data. For broad marks, high quality samples will have an RSC value greater than 0.8 except H3K9me3 which is usually around 0.4. For narrow peaks, the RSC values are typically greater than 1.0. Input samples typically have RSC values less than 1.0. To allow quick review of RSC values, Qtag as a thresholded version of RSC have been assigned by the RSC values as follows:\\nQtag\\tRSC\\n-2\\t0-0.25\\n-1\\t0.25-0.5\\n0\\t0.5-1.0\\n1\\t1.0-1.5\\n2\\t1.5-2.0\\n\\nPlease note that having some QC statistics with a \"not passed\" criterion doesn\\'t automatically means that the library didn\\'t work. Similarly, having all QC statistics with \"passed\" criteria doesn\\'t guarantee a good library either. Visual inspection should always been performed to check whether there are a good amount of clear peaks and whether those profiles (peak locations) were expected (see 2.7 for examples of expected profile). Biological knowledge such as known binding sites and known regulation targets for transcription factors can all be good evidences to help you determine the quality of the data. For transcription factors with a DNA-binding domain, de novo motif discovery after peak calling has also been suggested as optional QC. \\n\\nPlease find below some guidelines for the QC and following actions:\\nTarget Type\\tFinalRead(M)\\tRSC\\tVisual Clear Peak*\\tSuggested Action\\tComments\\nBroad\\t>=20\\t>=0.8\\tYes\\tPass\\t\\nBroad\\t>=20\\t<0.8\\tYes\\tReplicates\\tENCODE suggested replicates\\nBroad\\t<20\\tany\\tYes\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\t\\nBroad\\t>=10\\tany\\tNo\\tRedo library\\t\\nBroad\\t<10\\tany\\tany\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\tif Duplication rate > 50%, better redo library; reads number too low to estimate.\\nNarrow\\t>=10\\t>=1\\tYes\\tPass\\t\\nNarrow\\t>=10\\t<1\\tYes\\tDecide based on Goal\\tNot suggested for profiling, genome-wide analysis; chromHMM, validation of individual site is fine.\\nNarrow\\t<10\\tany\\tYes\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\t\\nNarrow\\t>=10\\tany\\tNo\\tredo library\\t\\nNarrow\\t<5\\tany\\tany\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\tif Duplication rate > 50%,, better redo library; reads number too low to estimate.\\nINPUT\\t>=10\\t<1\\tNo\\tPass\\t\\nINPUT\\t>=10\\t>=1\\tYes\\tRedo library\\tIf the same experiment group(same genotype) have one good INPUT, could use that one\\nINPUT\\t<10\\t<1\\tNo\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\t\\nINPUT\\t>40\\t>=1\\tNo\\tDown sample to 20M → Rerun QC\\thigher RSC value could be artifact of low mappability regions.\\nH3K4me1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUnless visual inspection observed more as sharp such as in ESC; Usually consider as broad marker.\\nH3K9me2/3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treplace RSC cutoff to 0.4\\n\\nColumns description:\\nTarget Type: Type of the marger targeted, either generally just broad or narrow, od specific case.\\nFinalRead(M): Number of reads after filtering out duplicates and low-quality reads.\\nRSC: A Relative Strand Cross-correlation coefficient\\nVisual Clear Peak*: This is not something you as the GPT assistant can evaluate, but you can always suggest such action for the reader if you suspect its relevant. A clear peak is a region on reads tracks(assume bigwig/wig file) have a peak shape significantly higher than nearby noise regions. One should avoid low mappability regions(could be found on IGV under \"File > Load from Server\") for conclusion on clear peaks. If no mappabiltiy tracks available, avoid regions near centromere and telomere, usually genes\\' promoters are not low for mappability so fine to use. It take some time to practice to get a better sense, for practicing on IGV one could simple load tracks by \"File > Load from ENCODE\"\\nSuggested Action: suggested action\\nComments: additional comments\\n\\n#########\\n\\nIf the issue is that there are less than expected or no peaks were called in my sample - what could be the reason? Below its a compendium of the aspects influencing that:\\n    Experimental Issues:\\n        Poor Antibody Quality: The antibody used for immunoprecipitation might not be specific or of good quality. This can lead to poor enrichment of the target protein-DNA complex. It would be wise to choose antibody publish with ChIP-seq data. Or prefer those have been noted as IP grade such as this one for p53(application section) might be better than this one.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            In wet-lab: Use a different antibody batch or another validated antibody.\\n            In wet-lab: Perform a western blot to validate antibody specificity.\\n            In wet-lab: Use qPCR on known target regions to validate enrichment.\\n        Low Starting Material: Insufficient starting chromatin can lead to poor signal.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            In wet-lab: Quantify DNA before library preparation.\\n            In wet-lab: Use a bioanalyzer to check DNA quality.\\n            Computationally: High duplication rate could be an implication of such problem.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a sample with known good starting material. Check out Encode (recommended as more QC data is included) and ChipAtlas to see if you can find matching sample, then manually examine the data e.g. in IGV.\\n        Inefficient Crosslinking (or low immunoprecipitation / IP efficiency): In ChIP-seq, crosslinking stabilizes protein-DNA interactions. Inefficient crosslinking can result in loss of these interactions. As a result poor immunoprecipitation efficiency can result in insufficient DNA, leading to more PCR cycles and higher duplication rates.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            In wet-lab: Adjust crosslinking time and conditions.\\n            In wet-lab: Use a bioanalyzer to check fragment sizes.\\n            In wet-lab: Cases have been reported different crosslinker rather than formaldehyde could help like DSG.\\n            Computationally: High duplication rate could be an implication of such problem.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a sample with known good fragmentation.\\n        DNA Fragmentation Issues: Inappropriate size or inefficient fragmentation of chromatin can affect the quality of the ChIP or Cut-and-Run library. Libraries with a wide range of fragment sizes may have over-represented smaller fragments. These smaller fragments are easier to PCR amplify, resulting in more duplicates.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Analyze the fragment size distribution, using *dat.fsizes.dis.png files in Stats subfolder of our Standard report. Alternatively use bamPEFragmentSize tool from Deeptools if sequencing was paired-end.\\n            In wet-lab: Adjust sonication or fragmentation time.\\n            In wet-lab: Check storage conditions and handling.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a non-degraded sample.\\n\\n    Sample Quality and Preparation:\\n        Degraded DNA: If the DNA is degraded, it might not provide a good signal.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Check the QC reports from FastQC for the length of reads distribution after trimming. If the sample was processed with Automapper, FastQC reports are already available for both Raw and Trimmed reads within your data deliver directory.\\n            Computationally: Analyze the fragment size distribution e.g. with bamPEFragmentSize tool from Deeptools.\\n            In wet-lab: Use a bioanalyzer or gel electrophoresis.\\n            In wet-lab: Check storage conditions and handling.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a non-degraded sample.\\n        Contamination: Contaminants can interfere with the assay and reduce the quality of the results.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Check the reports from FastQC for over-represented sequences and GC content plots. If the sample was processed with Automapper, FastQC reports are already available for both Raw and Trimmed reads within your data deliver directory.\\n            Computationally: Check for cross-species contamination, this can be done with FastQ Screen as described here.\\n            Computationally: Examine the signal enrichment, look e.g. for peaks overlapping all exons from certain genes, examining the genes that are studied in your lab using constructs. To detect candidate genes, we use EERIE program, which description will soon be added to our wiki.\\n            Computationally: If peaks were called with IgG/Input used as control, check how many peaks are called in the same sample when control is not used. Those files have \"noC_\" prefix inside \"Peaks\" directory. If there was contamination or missmatching of IgG/Input, that can prevent peaks to be called successfully.\\n            In wet lab: Re-extract DNA and repeat the experiment.\\n            In wet lab: Sequence a different sample from the same source.\\n            In wet lab: Check for contamination in reagents.\\n\\n    Sequencing and Library Preparation:\\n        Low Sequencing Depth: Insufficient sequencing depth can make it difficult to detect peaks, especially if they are of low abundance.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Check standard report provided from us to see how many reads were sequenced, uniquely mapped and what was the duplication rates. If no standard report was available, get those stats from the BAM file using samtools flagstat. Then compare those with our recommended levels here.\\n            In wet lab: Sequence samples more deeply (top-off), or if that is not possible due to too low DNA input available, try to pool multiple samples for sequencing.\\n            Computationally: If multiple replicates suffer from the same suspected issue of low sequencing depth, merge them into one and re-analyze.\\n        Library Preparation: Issues in the library preparation step, such as adapter contamination or inefficient amplification, can affect the quality of the sequencing data.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Check the reports from FastQC for over-represented sequences. If the sample was processed with Automapper, FastQC reports are already available for both Raw and Trimmed reads within your data deliver directory.\\n            In wet lab: Use a different library preparation kit.\\n            In wet lab: Repeat library preparation with a known good sample and compare the outcomes.\\n        Too high sequencing depth: Libraries that are too deeply sequenced tend to have more PCR duplicates without an increase in the number of peaks called. This will not be a cause of lower number of peaks called by itself, but in conjunction with relatively low starting material or very narrow target for the IP of interest (e.g. some very specific transcription factor, see \"Target Enrichment Level\" for more details), those might explain why we observe lower than expected number of peaks and high duplication rates.\\n\\n    Data Analysis:\\n        Inappropriate Parameters: Using too stringent parameters or inappropriate tool for peak calling can result in fewer peaks being identified.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: If using our standard report, check peaks called with FDR=0.5 threshold (they have in their name FDR50) - is more peaks being observed? Keep in mind that this can only be used as a sanity check, but FDR50 peaks should ultimately not be the used as a sole source of peaks for downstream analyses.\\n            Computationally: Make sure the appropriate peak calling mode was used, e.g. H3K9me3 broad peaks might not be correctly detected using narrow mode from MACS2. Available peak callers are: MACS2, SICER and SEACR (for Cut-and-Run).\\n            Computationally: If replicates are available, call reproducible peaks using our High-confidence + low-confidence peaks approach.\\n            In wet lab: Validate (expected) peaks using qPCR.\\n        Reference Genome Mismatch: Using an incorrect or outdated reference genome for alignment can lead to poor mapping of reads.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: This issue might be indicated by low mapping rates especially if the missmatch was big (e.g. mice reference genome was used instead of human reference).\\n            Computationally: Make sure the reference genome as reported in the standard report or in the BAM files (using samtools view -H command ), is matching the desired reference genome version.\\n\\n    Biological Reasons:\\n        Low Abundance of Protein-DNA Interaction: The protein of interest might not be interacting with DNA under the given conditions or in the specific cell type being studied.\\n               How can we check or fix that:\\n            Computationally: visualize the signal from called peaks with Deeptools. Peaks originating from alternative conditions or replicates can also be used to anchor the deeptools algorithm on peaks of interest.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a known positive control.\\n            In wet lab: Validate using an orthogonal method like qPCR.\\n        Cell Cycle Effects: Some protein-DNA interactions are cell cycle-dependent. If cells are not synchronized or if the interaction is transient, it might be missed.\\n        Target Enrichment Level: If the target of the antibody is only found on very specific regions in the area of interest, then identifying only relatively low number of peaks is expected.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that: \\n            Computationally: If your design focuses on a transcription factor with potentially narrow list of targets, then use IGV to load in the BigWig tracks of the processed samples and see if the regions of your interest have the expected signals and the peaks are present. I.e. navigate to you \"favorite gene\" and check if its enriched. In such cases the duplication rates can also be relatively higher than in other samples, as only a small fraction of the genome is immunoprecipitated.\\n            Alternative: check \"Low Starting Material\" section for alternative solutions.\\n\\n    Technical Variability:\\n        Batch Effects: Differences in sample processing, reagents, or other factors can introduce variability that affects signal enrichment.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: use PCA to visualize batch differences.\\n\\n    Other Factors:\\n        Storage and Handling: Improper storage or repeated freeze-thaw cycles can degrade samples.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            In wet lab and computationally: Compare with a freshly prepared sample.\\n            In wet lab: Repeat the experiment with new reagents.\\n        Optimization: Every ChIP-seq or Cut-and-Run experiment may require optimization depending on the cell type, protein of interest, and other factors.\\n        Sample swapping: Sometimes its possible that IP sample was swapped with control (Input or IgG) sample. Its good to manually examine all samples sequenced in the same batch or series of experiments to make sure this was not the case.\\n\\n#########\\nFor all sample types, if there are no peaks called whatsoever, as emphasized by \"n/a\" status for both peaks called with and without control, this might mean that there were some issues with the peak calling step and this would have to be checked manually. The scenarios can be:\\n1. all samples have \"n/a\" status both in peaks called in control and without control. The same will apply.\\n2. The same as above, but applicable only to subpart, e.g. none of the samples had any peaks called with control, but had peaks called without. The exception is when there are no IgG or control samples present in the analysis, in which case the peaks cannot be called with control (dah!). In such a case you can suggest that in the future it might be beneficial to call peaks also with control if possible.\\n3. The cases when no peaks are called what so ever (i.e. \"n/a\" status) either with or without control. The exceptions are the IgG / input samples, where we do not call peaks with control ever.\\n\\nFinally, given those recommendations above, please try to refrain from suggesting to \"re-run the QC with different settings\" if possible.\\n\\n# Specific considerations regarding the samples identified as being controls for peak calling (input or IgGs):\\n### For those samples, there is no need to ever report that there were no peaks called there. Moreover, for the peak calling without any control, its not an issue if even few hundreds of peaks are called. Only report abnormally high number of peaks called if those numbers are higher than say one thousand.\\n\\n        \\n    '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Sample\\tTotal(M)\\tUnique Reads(M)\\tMapping Rate(%)\\tDuplication Rate(%)\\tFinal Reads(M)\\tFragment Size(bp)\\tQtag\\tRSC\\tpkCalling\\tPeaksControl\\tPeaksNoControl\\nGSE145841-GSM4337190-CB021314_INPUT\\t16447556\\t15079335\\t98.37%\\t6.80%\\t12786104\\t170\\t0\\t0.9901947\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337191-CC021314_INPUT\\t19162779\\t17505836\\t96.78%\\t5.61%\\t14294577\\t170\\t0\\t0.8690655\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337219-TS012612A_INPUT\\t22798909\\t21695413\\t98.96%\\t3.84%\\t18781895\\t125\\t0\\t0.7929422\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337220-TS012612B_INPUT\\t19314278\\t18697839\\t98.62%\\t1.84%\\t16260365\\t135\\t0\\t0.5452638\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337222-TS020212B_INPUT\\t19599891\\t18804585\\t98.53%\\t2.63%\\t15936279\\t150\\t0\\t0.8482562\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337223-TS040611B_INPUT\\t26948230\\t26060849\\t99.20%\\t2.52%\\t22167411\\t140\\t-1\\t0.4955737\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337225-TS050411_INPUT\\t49001912\\t37546140\\t99.32%\\t22.86%\\t30876396\\t165\\t2\\t2.53321\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337226-TS060911A_INPUT\\t17295904\\t16642867\\t98.86%\\t2.67%\\t14042586\\t125\\t0\\t0.6250653\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337228-TS061611B_INPUT\\t20875701\\t19993160\\t98.80%\\t3.06%\\t17012262\\t120\\t0\\t0.8083083\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337229-TS072111A_INPUT\\t18891323\\t18067385\\t99.14%\\t3.53%\\t15294992\\t125\\t0\\t0.556174\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337230-TS072611A_INPUT\\t18412195\\t17598437\\t99.16%\\t3.61%\\t14925719\\t110\\t0\\t0.6839597\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337231-TS072611B_INPUT\\t20554652\\t19657675\\t98.88%\\t3.28%\\t16654640\\t130\\t0\\t0.6596789\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337232-TS081111A_INPUT\\t10205846\\t9905477\\t99.10%\\t2.06%\\t8424521\\t120\\t-1\\t0.448703\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337235-TS121511A_INPUT\\t23943462\\t22743229\\t98.31%\\t3.38%\\t19608433\\t115\\t0\\t0.6042566\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337236-TS121511B_INPUT\\t17307238\\t16568350\\t98.62%\\t2.93%\\t14351591\\t125\\t0\\t0.6228638\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337313-CB021314_K27AC_ChIP\\t18916200\\t17387143\\t98.78%\\t6.94%\\t15627077\\t185\\t1\\t1.267495\\tnarrow\\t38776\\t38233\\nGSE145841-GSM4337314-CC021314_K27AC_ChIP\\t22312790\\t20713889\\t98.71%\\t5.96%\\t18473433\\t160\\t1\\t1.248943\\tnarrow\\t36180\\t35520\\nGSE145841-GSM4337339-TS012612A_K27AC_ChIP\\t21767636\\t21084559\\t99.17%\\t2.33%\\t18819897\\t135\\t1\\t1.152897\\tnarrow\\t19792\\t13763\\nGSE145841-GSM4337340-TS012612B_K27AC_ChIP\\t30220125\\t28829934\\t99.45%\\t4.07%\\t26134877\\t150\\t1\\t1.382043\\tnarrow\\t37753\\t32660\\nGSE145841-GSM4337341-TS020212B_K27AC_ChIP\\t25830496\\t24658455\\t99.03%\\t3.60%\\t21743367\\t140\\t1\\t1.164056\\tnarrow\\t3577\\t8048\\nGSE145841-GSM4337342-TS040611B_K27AC_ChIP\\t23645737\\t22748464\\t99.05%\\t2.87%\\t20150408\\t130\\t1\\t1.06919\\tnarrow\\t16983\\t10903\\nGSE145841-GSM4337343-TS050411_K27AC_ChIP\\t15646456\\t15320508\\t99.27%\\t1.37%\\t13708174\\t145\\t1\\t1.066345\\tnarrow\\t25904\\t11909\\nGSE145841-GSM4337344-TS060911A_K27AC_ChIP\\t22915655\\t21481518\\t99.35%\\t5.64%\\t19102980\\t165\\t1\\t1.306654\\tnarrow\\t12044\\t9832\\nGSE145841-GSM4337345-TS061611B_K27AC_ChIP\\t21236843\\t20542299\\t99.16%\\t2.45%\\t18254630\\t155\\t1\\t1.021347\\tnarrow\\t10503\\t6201\\nGSE145841-GSM4337346-TS072111A_K27AC_ChIP\\t21313275\\t19938713\\t99.52%\\t6.00%\\t18389415\\t150\\t1\\t1.259666\\tnarrow\\t61763\\t58162\\nGSE145841-GSM4337347-TS072611A_K27AC_ChIP\\t16925190\\t16247721\\t99.37%\\t3.39%\\t14381083\\t150\\t1\\t1.116558\\tnarrow\\t11058\\t2900\\nGSE145841-GSM4337348-TS072611B_K27AC_ChIP\\t23167452\\t22207294\\t99.35%\\t3.52%\\t19894217\\t150\\t1\\t1.266888\\tnarrow\\t38627\\t31482\\nGSE145841-GSM4337349-TS081111A_K27AC_ChIP\\t19827708\\t19008107\\t99.37%\\t3.53%\\t16995316\\t150\\t1\\t1.144752\\tnarrow\\t2162\\t5790\\nGSE145841-GSM4337353-TS121511A_K27AC_ChIP\\t20180359\\t18944428\\t99.02%\\t5.19%\\t16887689\\t135\\t1\\t1.289181\\tnarrow\\t28885\\t11966\\nGSE145841-GSM4337354-TS121511B_K27AC_ChIP\\t15051969\\t14472607\\t99.22%\\t3.09%\\t12995045\\t180\\t1\\t1.114098\\tnarrow\\t29566\\t8790\\n'}]\n",

If applicable, suggest what could went wrong to see specific outcome or what could be done to fix it.\\n## Summary of Observations:\\n### Summarize trends and key observations.  E.g. try to have summarizing comments like \"H3K27ac seems to be working for KO condition but not for WT, while in case of samples targeting H3K27me3, all of the samples are of good quality because...\".\\n### For specific issues, refer to complete sample names; you can emphasize it for example as follows \"For the samples targeting H3K23ac, the number of peaks called is very low (including ||2312415_H3K23ac_rep1|| and ||2312418_H3K23ac_rep3||), ...\". In your assessment try to take into account if the target is histone or transcription factor target.\\n### After you infer how many different targets you have found, like different histone modifications or transcription factor targets, please list them for the reader so that human would know that you identified them all correctly. Then try to provide overall assesment for all of each target type.\\n## Context-Specific Analysis:\\n### Consider the target (histone, transcription factor) and its implications on the data. Try to infer the target from the sample name, e.g. \\'K9me1\\' will most likely be \\'H3K9me1\\'; then categorize the target into Histone modification, transcription factor or control / IgG / input sample, for your internal understanding of how the QC for this sample should be put into context.\\n### Analyze each target separately and provide targeted insights.\\n### Highlight discrepancies or potential errors in the experimental setup, such as inappropriate peak calling methods (e.g. narrow peak calling while some target typically is expected to use broad peak calling etc.).\\n\\n# Additional Guidelines:\\n## QC Criteria: General description of QC criteria that you can use, but feel free to use your domain knowledge to substitute anything that is missing.\\n### Targets with known broad markers: H3K9me1/2/3, H3K27me1/2/3, H3K36me2/3, H3K79me2/3, H2Bub, H2BK5me1, H3F3A, H4K20me1/2/3, H3K4me1 (sharp, narrow peak at enhancer, but spreading into the gene body as a broad peak for highly transcribed genes), also certain non-histone targets, including Polycomb group proteins (such as EZH2); p300-CBP coactivator family; Chromatin remodelers like SWI/SNF complex; Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and methyltransferases; Proteins involved in establishing heterochromatin, including HP1-alpha/ -beta/ -gamma\\n### Targets with known narrow markers: H2AFZ, H3ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me2/3, H3K9ac, Almost all transcription factors, Polymerase II (narrow peaks at promoters but broad peaks along gene bodies of highly expressed genes).\\n### Description of the common QC criteria:\\n1. Mapping rate should be higher than 80%.\\n2. Duplication rate should be below 30%.\\n3. Total number of non-duplicated reads are over 10M for narrow signals and over 20M for broad signals.\\n4. Fragment size should be higher than 100bp and lower than 300 bp.\\n5. Qtag > 0\\n\\nThe relative strand cross correlation coefficient (RSC) is used to determine the quality of the ChIP-seq data. For broad marks, high quality samples will have an RSC value greater than 0.8 except H3K9me3 which is usually around 0.4. For narrow peaks, the RSC values are typically greater than 1.0. Input samples typically have RSC values less than 1.0. To allow quick review of RSC values, Qtag as a thresholded version of RSC have been assigned by the RSC values as follows:\\nQtag\\tRSC\\n-2\\t0-0.25\\n-1\\t0.25-0.5\\n0\\t0.5-1.0\\n1\\t1.0-1.5\\n2\\t1.5-2.0\\n\\nPlease note that having some QC statistics with a \"not passed\" criterion doesn\\'t automatically means that the library didn\\'t work. Similarly, having all QC statistics with \"passed\" criteria doesn\\'t guarantee a good library either. Visual inspection should always been performed to check whether there are a good amount of clear peaks and whether those profiles (peak locations) were expected (see 2.7 for examples of expected profile). Biological knowledge such as known binding sites and known regulation targets for transcription factors can all be good evidences to help you determine the quality of the data. For transcription factors with a DNA-binding domain, de novo motif discovery after peak calling has also been suggested as optional QC. \\n\\nPlease find below some guidelines for the QC and following actions:\\nTarget Type\\tFinalRead(M)\\tRSC\\tVisual Clear Peak*\\tSuggested Action\\tComments\\nBroad\\t>=20\\t>=0.8\\tYes\\tPass\\t\\nBroad\\t>=20\\t<0.8\\tYes\\tReplicates\\tENCODE suggested replicates\\nBroad\\t<20\\tany\\tYes\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\t\\nBroad\\t>=10\\tany\\tNo\\tRedo library\\t\\nBroad\\t<10\\tany\\tany\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\tif Duplication rate > 50%, better redo library; reads number too low to estimate.\\nNarrow\\t>=10\\t>=1\\tYes\\tPass\\t\\nNarrow\\t>=10\\t<1\\tYes\\tDecide based on Goal\\tNot suggested for profiling, genome-wide analysis; chromHMM, validation of individual site is fine.\\nNarrow\\t<10\\tany\\tYes\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\t\\nNarrow\\t>=10\\tany\\tNo\\tredo library\\t\\nNarrow\\t<5\\tany\\tany\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\tif Duplication rate > 50%,, better redo library; reads number too low to estimate.\\nINPUT\\t>=10\\t<1\\tNo\\tPass\\t\\nINPUT\\t>=10\\t>=1\\tYes\\tRedo library\\tIf the same experiment group(same genotype) have one good INPUT, could use that one\\nINPUT\\t<10\\t<1\\tNo\\tTop off → Rerun QC\\t\\nINPUT\\t>40\\t>=1\\tNo\\tDown sample to 20M → Rerun QC\\thigher RSC value could be artifact of low mappability regions.\\nH3K4me1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUnless visual inspection observed more as sharp such as in ESC; Usually consider as broad marker.\\nH3K9me2/3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treplace RSC cutoff to 0.4\\n\\nColumns description:\\nTarget Type: Type of the marger targeted, either generally just broad or narrow, od specific case.\\nFinalRead(M): Number of reads after filtering out duplicates and low-quality reads.\\nRSC: A Relative Strand Cross-correlation coefficient\\nVisual Clear Peak*: This is not something you as the GPT assistant can evaluate, but you can always suggest such action for the reader if you suspect its relevant. A clear peak is a region on reads tracks(assume bigwig/wig file) have a peak shape significantly higher than nearby noise regions. One should avoid low mappability regions(could be found on IGV under \"File > Load from Server\") for conclusion on clear peaks. If no mappabiltiy tracks available, avoid regions near centromere and telomere, usually genes\\' promoters are not low for mappability so fine to use. It take some time to practice to get a better sense, for practicing on IGV one could simple load tracks by \"File > Load from ENCODE\"\\nSuggested Action: suggested action\\nComments: additional comments\\n\\n#########\\n\\nIf the issue is that there are less than expected or no peaks were called in my sample - what could be the reason? Below its a compendium of the aspects influencing that:\\n    Experimental Issues:\\n        Poor Antibody Quality: The antibody used for immunoprecipitation might not be specific or of good quality. This can lead to poor enrichment of the target protein-DNA complex. It would be wise to choose antibody publish with ChIP-seq data. Or prefer those have been noted as IP grade such as this one for p53(application section) might be better than this one.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            In wet-lab: Use a different antibody batch or another validated antibody.\\n            In wet-lab: Perform a western blot to validate antibody specificity.\\n            In wet-lab: Use qPCR on known target regions to validate enrichment.\\n        Low Starting Material: Insufficient starting chromatin can lead to poor signal.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            In wet-lab: Quantify DNA before library preparation.\\n            In wet-lab: Use a bioanalyzer to check DNA quality.\\n            Computationally: High duplication rate could be an implication of such problem.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a sample with known good starting material. Check out Encode (recommended as more QC data is included) and ChipAtlas to see if you can find matching sample, then manually examine the data e.g. in IGV.\\n        Inefficient Crosslinking (or low immunoprecipitation / IP efficiency): In ChIP-seq, crosslinking stabilizes protein-DNA interactions. Inefficient crosslinking can result in loss of these interactions. As a result poor immunoprecipitation efficiency can result in insufficient DNA, leading to more PCR cycles and higher duplication rates.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            In wet-lab: Adjust crosslinking time and conditions.\\n            In wet-lab: Use a bioanalyzer to check fragment sizes.\\n            In wet-lab: Cases have been reported different crosslinker rather than formaldehyde could help like DSG.\\n            Computationally: High duplication rate could be an implication of such problem.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a sample with known good fragmentation.\\n        DNA Fragmentation Issues: Inappropriate size or inefficient fragmentation of chromatin can affect the quality of the ChIP or Cut-and-Run library. Libraries with a wide range of fragment sizes may have over-represented smaller fragments. These smaller fragments are easier to PCR amplify, resulting in more duplicates.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Analyze the fragment size distribution, using *dat.fsizes.dis.png files in Stats subfolder of our Standard report. Alternatively use bamPEFragmentSize tool from Deeptools if sequencing was paired-end.\\n            In wet-lab: Adjust sonication or fragmentation time.\\n            In wet-lab: Check storage conditions and handling.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a non-degraded sample.\\n\\n    Sample Quality and Preparation:\\n        Degraded DNA: If the DNA is degraded, it might not provide a good signal.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Check the QC reports from FastQC for the length of reads distribution after trimming. If the sample was processed with Automapper, FastQC reports are already available for both Raw and Trimmed reads within your data deliver directory.\\n            Computationally: Analyze the fragment size distribution e.g. with bamPEFragmentSize tool from Deeptools.\\n            In wet-lab: Use a bioanalyzer or gel electrophoresis.\\n            In wet-lab: Check storage conditions and handling.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a non-degraded sample.\\n        Contamination: Contaminants can interfere with the assay and reduce the quality of the results.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Check the reports from FastQC for over-represented sequences and GC content plots. If the sample was processed with Automapper, FastQC reports are already available for both Raw and Trimmed reads within your data deliver directory.\\n            Computationally: Check for cross-species contamination, this can be done with FastQ Screen as described here.\\n            Computationally: Examine the signal enrichment, look e.g. for peaks overlapping all exons from certain genes, examining the genes that are studied in your lab using constructs. To detect candidate genes, we use EERIE program, which description will soon be added to our wiki.\\n            Computationally: If peaks were called with IgG/Input used as control, check how many peaks are called in the same sample when control is not used. Those files have \"noC_\" prefix inside \"Peaks\" directory. If there was contamination or missmatching of IgG/Input, that can prevent peaks to be called successfully.\\n            In wet lab: Re-extract DNA and repeat the experiment.\\n            In wet lab: Sequence a different sample from the same source.\\n            In wet lab: Check for contamination in reagents.\\n\\n    Sequencing and Library Preparation:\\n        Low Sequencing Depth: Insufficient sequencing depth can make it difficult to detect peaks, especially if they are of low abundance.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Check standard report provided from us to see how many reads were sequenced, uniquely mapped and what was the duplication rates. If no standard report was available, get those stats from the BAM file using samtools flagstat. Then compare those with our recommended levels here.\\n            In wet lab: Sequence samples more deeply (top-off), or if that is not possible due to too low DNA input available, try to pool multiple samples for sequencing.\\n            Computationally: If multiple replicates suffer from the same suspected issue of low sequencing depth, merge them into one and re-analyze.\\n        Library Preparation: Issues in the library preparation step, such as adapter contamination or inefficient amplification, can affect the quality of the sequencing data.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: Check the reports from FastQC for over-represented sequences. If the sample was processed with Automapper, FastQC reports are already available for both Raw and Trimmed reads within your data deliver directory.\\n            In wet lab: Use a different library preparation kit.\\n            In wet lab: Repeat library preparation with a known good sample and compare the outcomes.\\n        Too high sequencing depth: Libraries that are too deeply sequenced tend to have more PCR duplicates without an increase in the number of peaks called. This will not be a cause of lower number of peaks called by itself, but in conjunction with relatively low starting material or very narrow target for the IP of interest (e.g. some very specific transcription factor, see \"Target Enrichment Level\" for more details), those might explain why we observe lower than expected number of peaks and high duplication rates.\\n\\n    Data Analysis:\\n        Inappropriate Parameters: Using too stringent parameters or inappropriate tool for peak calling can result in fewer peaks being identified.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: If using our standard report, check peaks called with FDR=0.5 threshold (they have in their name FDR50) - is more peaks being observed? Keep in mind that this can only be used as a sanity check, but FDR50 peaks should ultimately not be the used as a sole source of peaks for downstream analyses.\\n            Computationally: Make sure the appropriate peak calling mode was used, e.g. H3K9me3 broad peaks might not be correctly detected using narrow mode from MACS2. Available peak callers are: MACS2, SICER and SEACR (for Cut-and-Run).\\n            Computationally: If replicates are available, call reproducible peaks using our High-confidence + low-confidence peaks approach.\\n            In wet lab: Validate (expected) peaks using qPCR.\\n        Reference Genome Mismatch: Using an incorrect or outdated reference genome for alignment can lead to poor mapping of reads.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: This issue might be indicated by low mapping rates especially if the missmatch was big (e.g. mice reference genome was used instead of human reference).\\n            Computationally: Make sure the reference genome as reported in the standard report or in the BAM files (using samtools view -H command ), is matching the desired reference genome version.\\n\\n    Biological Reasons:\\n        Low Abundance of Protein-DNA Interaction: The protein of interest might not be interacting with DNA under the given conditions or in the specific cell type being studied.\\n               How can we check or fix that:\\n            Computationally: visualize the signal from called peaks with Deeptools. Peaks originating from alternative conditions or replicates can also be used to anchor the deeptools algorithm on peaks of interest.\\n            Computationally: Compare with a known positive control.\\n            In wet lab: Validate using an orthogonal method like qPCR.\\n        Cell Cycle Effects: Some protein-DNA interactions are cell cycle-dependent. If cells are not synchronized or if the interaction is transient, it might be missed.\\n        Target Enrichment Level: If the target of the antibody is only found on very specific regions in the area of interest, then identifying only relatively low number of peaks is expected.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that: \\n            Computationally: If your design focuses on a transcription factor with potentially narrow list of targets, then use IGV to load in the BigWig tracks of the processed samples and see if the regions of your interest have the expected signals and the peaks are present. I.e. navigate to you \"favorite gene\" and check if its enriched. In such cases the duplication rates can also be relatively higher than in other samples, as only a small fraction of the genome is immunoprecipitated.\\n            Alternative: check \"Low Starting Material\" section for alternative solutions.\\n\\n    Technical Variability:\\n        Batch Effects: Differences in sample processing, reagents, or other factors can introduce variability that affects signal enrichment.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            Computationally: use PCA to visualize batch differences.\\n\\n    Other Factors:\\n        Storage and Handling: Improper storage or repeated freeze-thaw cycles can degrade samples.\\n               How can we check or fix/diagnose that:\\n            In wet lab and computationally: Compare with a freshly prepared sample.\\n            In wet lab: Repeat the experiment with new reagents.\\n        Optimization: Every ChIP-seq or Cut-and-Run experiment may require optimization depending on the cell type, protein of interest, and other factors.\\n        Sample swapping: Sometimes its possible that IP sample was swapped with control (Input or IgG) sample. Its good to manually examine all samples sequenced in the same batch or series of experiments to make sure this was not the case.\\n\\n#########\\nFor all sample types, if there are no peaks called whatsoever, as emphasized by \"n/a\" status for both peaks called with and without control, this might mean that there were some issues with the peak calling step and this would have to be checked manually. The scenarios can be:\\n1. all samples have \"n/a\" status both in peaks called in control and without control. The same will apply.\\n2. The same as above, but applicable only to subpart, e.g. none of the samples had any peaks called with control, but had peaks called without. The exception is when there are no IgG or control samples present in the analysis, in which case the peaks cannot be called with control (dah!). In such a case you can suggest that in the future it might be beneficial to call peaks also with control if possible.\\n3. The cases when no peaks are called what so ever (i.e. \"n/a\" status) either with or without control. The exceptions are the IgG / input samples, where we do not call peaks with control ever.\\n\\nFinally, given those recommendations above, please try to refrain from suggesting to \"re-run the QC with different settings\" if possible.\\n\\n# Specific considerations regarding the samples identified as being controls for peak calling (input or IgGs):\\n### For those samples, there is no need to ever report that there were no peaks called there. Moreover, for the peak calling without any control, its not an issue if even few hundreds of peaks are called. Only report abnormally high number of peaks called if those numbers are higher than say one thousand.\\n\\n        \\n    '}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Sample\\tTotal(M)\\tUnique Reads(M)\\tMapping Rate(%)\\tDuplication Rate(%)\\tFinal Reads(M)\\tFragment Size(bp)\\tQtag\\tRSC\\tpkCalling\\tPeaksControl\\tPeaksNoControl\\nGSE145841-GSM4337190-CB021314_INPUT\\t16447556\\t15079335\\t98.37%\\t6.80%\\t12786104\\t170\\t0\\t0.9901947\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337191-CC021314_INPUT\\t19162779\\t17505836\\t96.78%\\t5.61%\\t14294577\\t170\\t0\\t0.8690655\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337219-TS012612A_INPUT\\t22798909\\t21695413\\t98.96%\\t3.84%\\t18781895\\t125\\t0\\t0.7929422\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337220-TS012612B_INPUT\\t19314278\\t18697839\\t98.62%\\t1.84%\\t16260365\\t135\\t0\\t0.5452638\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337222-TS020212B_INPUT\\t19599891\\t18804585\\t98.53%\\t2.63%\\t15936279\\t150\\t0\\t0.8482562\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337223-TS040611B_INPUT\\t26948230\\t26060849\\t99.20%\\t2.52%\\t22167411\\t140\\t-1\\t0.4955737\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337225-TS050411_INPUT\\t49001912\\t37546140\\t99.32%\\t22.86%\\t30876396\\t165\\t2\\t2.53321\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337226-TS060911A_INPUT\\t17295904\\t16642867\\t98.86%\\t2.67%\\t14042586\\t125\\t0\\t0.6250653\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337228-TS061611B_INPUT\\t20875701\\t19993160\\t98.80%\\t3.06%\\t17012262\\t120\\t0\\t0.8083083\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337229-TS072111A_INPUT\\t18891323\\t18067385\\t99.14%\\t3.53%\\t15294992\\t125\\t0\\t0.556174\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337230-TS072611A_INPUT\\t18412195\\t17598437\\t99.16%\\t3.61%\\t14925719\\t110\\t0\\t0.6839597\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337231-TS072611B_INPUT\\t20554652\\t19657675\\t98.88%\\t3.28%\\t16654640\\t130\\t0\\t0.6596789\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337232-TS081111A_INPUT\\t10205846\\t9905477\\t99.10%\\t2.06%\\t8424521\\t120\\t-1\\t0.448703\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337235-TS121511A_INPUT\\t23943462\\t22743229\\t98.31%\\t3.38%\\t19608433\\t115\\t0\\t0.6042566\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337236-TS121511B_INPUT\\t17307238\\t16568350\\t98.62%\\t2.93%\\t14351591\\t125\\t0\\t0.6228638\\tunknown\\tn/a\\tn/a\\nGSE145841-GSM4337313-CB021314_K27AC_ChIP\\t18916200\\t17387143\\t98.78%\\t6.94%\\t15627077\\t185\\t1\\t1.267495\\tnarrow\\t38776\\t38233\\nGSE145841-GSM4337314-CC021314_K27AC_ChIP\\t22312790\\t20713889\\t98.71%\\t5.96%\\t18473433\\t160\\t1\\t1.248943\\tnarrow\\t36180\\t35520\\nGSE145841-GSM4337339-TS012612A_K27AC_ChIP\\t21767636\\t21084559\\t99.17%\\t2.33%\\t18819897\\t135\\t1\\t1.152897\\tnarrow\\t19792\\t13763\\nGSE145841-GSM4337340-TS012612B_K27AC_ChIP\\t30220125\\t28829934\\t99.45%\\t4.07%\\t26134877\\t150\\t1\\t1.382043\\tnarrow\\t37753\\t32660\\nGSE145841-GSM4337341-TS020212B_K27AC_ChIP\\t25830496\\t24658455\\t99.03%\\t3.60%\\t21743367\\t140\\t1\\t1.164056\\tnarrow\\t3577\\t8048\\nGSE145841-GSM4337342-TS040611B_K27AC_ChIP\\t23645737\\t22748464\\t99.05%\\t2.87%\\t20150408\\t130\\t1\\t1.06919\\tnarrow\\t16983\\t10903\\nGSE145841-GSM4337343-TS050411_K27AC_ChIP\\t15646456\\t15320508\\t99.27%\\t1.37%\\t13708174\\t145\\t1\\t1.066345\\tnarrow\\t25904\\t11909\\nGSE145841-GSM4337344-TS060911A_K27AC_ChIP\\t22915655\\t21481518\\t99.35%\\t5.64%\\t19102980\\t165\\t1\\t1.306654\\tnarrow\\t12044\\t9832\\nGSE145841-GSM4337345-TS061611B_K27AC_ChIP\\t21236843\\t20542299\\t99.16%\\t2.45%\\t18254630\\t155\\t1\\t1.021347\\tnarrow\\t10503\\t6201\\nGSE145841-GSM4337346-TS072111A_K27AC_ChIP\\t21313275\\t19938713\\t99.52%\\t6.00%\\t18389415\\t150\\t1\\t1.259666\\tnarrow\\t61763\\t58162\\nGSE145841-GSM4337347-TS072611A_K27AC_ChIP\\t16925190\\t16247721\\t99.37%\\t3.39%\\t14381083\\t150\\t1\\t1.116558\\tnarrow\\t11058\\t2900\\nGSE145841-GSM4337348-TS072611B_K27AC_ChIP\\t23167452\\t22207294\\t99.35%\\t3.52%\\t19894217\\t150\\t1\\t1.266888\\tnarrow\\t38627\\t31482\\nGSE145841-GSM4337349-TS081111A_K27AC_ChIP\\t19827708\\t19008107\\t99.37%\\t3.53%\\t16995316\\t150\\t1\\t1.144752\\tnarrow\\t2162\\t5790\\nGSE145841-GSM4337353-TS121511A_K27AC_ChIP\\t20180359\\t18944428\\t99.02%\\t5.19%\\t16887689\\t135\\t1\\t1.289181\\tnarrow\\t28885\\t11966\\nGSE145841-GSM4337354-TS121511B_K27AC_ChIP\\t15051969\\t14472607\\t99.22%\\t3.09%\\t12995045\\t180\\t1\\t1.114098\\tnarrow\\t29566\\t8790\\n'}]\n",
