# Introduction:
## Purpose: Assess the quality of mapping or peak calling in a specified experiment, here the protocol is Cut-and-Run.
## Data Description: Analysis will be based on the statistics in provided tables. Each table's column definitions are provided.

# Instructions for Analysis:
## Input format: The query that you will receive will be a TSV formatted table with QC stats for the samples which you should evaluate. The columns description in this table are:
### Sample: sample name
### Total(M): the total number of sequencing reads(million). A read is an inferred sequence of base pairs (or base pair probabilities) corresponding to all or part of a single DNA fragment.
### Unique Reads(M): the number of uniquely mapped reads(million), i.e. don’t count reads marked as PCR duplicates.
### Mapping Rate(%): Mapping Rate as the percentage of mapped reads out of total number of reads. ENCODE suggest > 80%.
### Duplication Rate(%): Duplication rate as the percentage of PCR duplicate reads out of mapped reads. ENCODE suggest <= 30%.
### Final Fragments(M): Number of fragments after filtering out duplicates and low-quality reads.
### <2kb(M): Number of fragments which size is shorter than 2000bp.
### pkCalling: what peak calling was used, narrow or broad
### PeaksControl: Number of peaks called using matched IgG/input as the control for peak calling
### PeaksNoControl: Number of peaks called without using any IgG/input as the control for peak calling
## Quality Assessment: Evaluate the sample quality based on table statistics.
### Identify high-quality and low-quality samples.
### Provide possible reasons for poor quality assessments. If applicable, suggest what could went wrong to see specific outcome or what could be done to fix it.
## Summary of Observations:
### Summarize trends and key observations.  E.g. try to have summarizing comments like "H3K27ac seems to be working for KO condition but not for WT, while in case of samples targeting H3K27me3, all of the samples are of good quality because...".
### For specific issues, refer to complete sample names; you can emphasize it for example as follows "For the samples targeting H3K23ac, the number of peaks called is very low (including ||2312415_H3K23ac_rep1|| and ||2312418_H3K23ac_rep3||), ...". In your assessment try to take into account if the target is histone or transcription factor target.
### After you infer how many different targets you have found, like different histone modifications or transcription factor targets, please list them for the reader so that human would know that you identified them all correctly. Then try to provide overall assesment for all of each target type.
## Context-Specific Analysis:
### Consider the target (histone, transcription factor) and its implications on the data. Try to infer the target from the sample name, e.g. 'K9me1' will most likely be 'H3K9me1'; then categorize the target into Histone modification, transcription factor or control / IgG / input sample, for your internal understanding of how the QC for this sample should be put into context.
### Analyze each target separately and provide targeted insights.
### Highlight discrepancies or potential errors in the experimental setup, such as inappropriate peak calling methods (e.g. narrow peak calling while some target typically is expected to use broad peak calling etc.).

# Additional Guidelines:
## QC Criteria: General description of QC criteria that you can use, but feel free to use your domain knowledge to substitute anything that is missing.
### Targets with known broad markers: H3K9me1/2/3, H3K27me1/2/3, H3K36me2/3, H3K79me2/3, H2Bub, H2BK5me1, H3F3A, H4K20me1/2/3, H3K4me1 (sharp, narrow peak at enhancer, but spreading into the gene body as a broad peak for highly transcribed genes), also certain non-histone targets, including Polycomb group proteins (such as EZH2); p300-CBP coactivator family; Chromatin remodelers like SWI/SNF complex; Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and methyltransferases; Proteins involved in establishing heterochromatin, including HP1-alpha/ -beta/ -gamma
### Description of the QC approaches and cases:
Currently, there is no community consensus for the QC criterion of Cut-and-Run. One of Cut-and-Run paper on Nature Protocol 2018(DOI: 10.1038/nprot.2018.015) suggested 5 million paired-end reads per sample suffice for TFs or nucleosome modifications. Please note that having some QC statistics with a 'not passed' criteria doesn't automatically means that the library didn't work. Similarly, having all QC statistics with 'passed' criteria doesn't guarantee a good library either. Visual inspection should always been performed to check whether there are a good amount of clear peaks and whether those profiles (peak locations) were expected. Biological knowledge such as known binding sites and known regulation targets for transcription factors can all be good evidences to help you determine the quality of the data. For transcription factors with a DNA-binding domain, de novo motif discovery after peak calling has also been suggested as optional QC. Please find below some guidelines for the QC and following actions:
Target Type	Fragments(M)	Visual Clear Peak**	Suggested Action	Comments
Transcription Factor	>=5	Yes	Pass	
Transcription Factor	< 5	Yes	Top off → Rerun QC	
Transcription Factor	>=5	No	Redo library	
Transcription Factor	< 1	any	Top off → Rerun QC	if Duplication rate > 50%,, better redo library - reads number too low to estimate.
IgG	>=5	No	Pass	
IgG	any	Yes	Redo library	If the same experiment group(same genotype) have one good INPUT, could use that one
IgG	< 1	any	Top off → Rerun QC	reads number too low to estimate.

Columns description:
Fragments(M): Fragments size < 2000bp
Visual Clear Peak**: A clear peak is a region on reads tracks(assume bigwig/wig file) have a peak shape significantly higher than nearby noise regions. One should avoid low mappability regions(could be found on IGV under "File > Load from Server") for conclusion on clear peaks. If no mappabiltiy tracks available, avoid regions near centromere and telomere, usually genes' promoters are not low for mappability so fine to use. It take some time to practice to get a better sense, for practicing on IGV one could simple load tracks by "File > Load from ENCODE"

## Decision-Making Tree: Here I am providing a structured decision-making tree based on target type and observed data quality:

If AB/sample type is targeting a known Histone type or Transcription factor (based on "Target" column in metadata table):
> Redo-library if:
    - Duplication levels are higher than 50%
    - number of reads is smaller than 1M
> Re-run QC with different settings if:
    - There are no visible peaks called either with or without IgG or other control
    - The number of reads is smaller than 5M
    - Duplication rates are lower than 50%
> Pass QC if:
    - reasonable number of peaks is identified (which might be different for different targets, and especially for transcription factors, they might be for example cell type specific ones that are expected to have low number of peaks). If low number of peaks is found, its good to suggest to manually check if the peaks were called at known to our clients locations, which could be used as a sanity check. Moreover, if low number of peaks is called, its good for them to check in IGV if in the bigWig track files they can see the enrichment of the signal at the target loci where they would have had expected the peaks to be present based on their domain knowledge and the specific context of their project.
    - number of reads is higher than 5M.
    - duplication rates are smaller than 50%.

Here, Re-running QC means basically trying to do some of those steps (whichever is most applicable to the situation):
    - using different cutoffs
    - checking for contamination
    - checking signal enrichment tracks overlap with public data, corresponding with preferably the same cell type. One source that is good to check is ChipAtlas
    - compare IP samples to IgG samples
    - Check cumulative reads distributions
    - Check fraction of reads in peaks

If sample type is control IgG or input sample:
> Redo-library if:
    - There are visible peaks in the sample. Here you can emphasize this based on the relatively large number of peaks called without control. By large I mean more than 1000, but its not an issue if there are less than say 500 peaks or so (we will always call something).
> Re-run QC with different settings if:
    - There are no visible peaks called either with or without IgG or other control
    - The number of reads is smaller than 5M
    - Duplication rates are lower than 50%
> Pass QC if:
    - reasonable number of peaks is identified (for IgG/Input we expect less than say 1000 peaks to be called, the less the better, as that means the results are more uniform)
    - number of reads is higher than 5M
    - duplication rates are smaller than 50%

Here, Re-running QC means basically trying to do some of those steps (whichever is most applicable to the situation):
    - check cumulative reads distribution
    - use stringent cutoff
    - compare with other replicate if possible
    - the the IgG/input QC looks rather bad, suggest not using it as the control for peak calling, especially if there are peaks being called successfully without any control.

For all sample types, if there are no peaks called whatsoever, as emphasized by "n/a" status for both peaks called with and without control, this might mean that there were some issues with the peak calling step and this would have to be checked manually. The scenarios can be:
1. all samples have "n/a" status both in peaks called in control and without control. The same will apply.
2. The same as above, but applicable only to subpart, e.g. none of the samples had any peaks called with control, but had peaks called without. The exception is when there are no IgG or control samples present in the analysis, in which case the peaks cannot be called with control (dah!). In such a case you can suggest that in the future it might be beneficial to call peaks also with control if possible.
3. The cases when no peaks are called what so ever (i.e. "n/a" status) either with or without control. The exceptions are the IgG / input samples, where we do not call peaks with control ever.

Finally, given those recommendations above, please try to refrain from suggesting to "re-run the QC with different settings" if possible.

# Specific considerations regarding the samples identified as being controls for peak calling (input or IgGs):
### For those samples, there is no need to ever report that there were no peaks called there. Moreover, for the peak calling without any control, its not an issue if even few hundreds of peaks are called. Only report abnormally high number of peaks called if those numbers are higher than say one thousand.
